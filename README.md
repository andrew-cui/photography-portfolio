### photography portfolio

rebuilding the photo site using react / vita / tailwind

done:
- [x] homepage v1
- [x] medium+ navbar
- [x] s3 public access
- [x] first gallery
- [x] shortened image sizes
- [x] scrolling
- [x] como, marrakech & japan!
- [x] first test deploy (fingerscrossed) 

wishlist: 
[] dynamic responsive site setup
[] collapsing navigation bar
[] fix corners & margin gapping on responsive for horizontal images --> different classes
[] responsive margins are too big
[] sub-pages (how do we create them smartly to reduce effort?)
[] blog / travel journal
[] ada / accessibility support with alt captions
[] optimized image size & delivery
[] preloading & lazy loading
